## Truly Standard-Essential Patents? A Semantics-Based Analysis

### CEPR Discussion Paper No. DP14726

### with Fabian Gaessler and Dietmar Harhoff

Abstract: Standard-essential patents (SEPs) have become a key element of technical coordination in standard-setting organizations. Yet, in many cases, it remains unclear whether a declared SEP is truly standard-essential. To date, there is no automated procedure that allows for a scalable and objective assessment of SEP status. This paper introduces a semantics-based method for approximating the standard essentiality of patents. We provide details on the procedure that generates the measure of standard essentiality and present the results of several validation exercises. In a first empirical application we illustrate the measure's usefulness in estimating the share of true SEPs in firm patent portfolios for several mobile telecommunication standards. We find firm-level differences that are statistically significant and economically substantial. Furthermore, we observe a general decline in the average share of presumably true SEPs between successive standard generations.



## Approximating the Standard-Essentiality of Patents - A Semantics-Based Analysis

### Report for the European Patent Office Academic Research Programme

### with Fabian Gaessler and Dietmar Harhoff

Abstract: The development of interoperability standards such as WiFi or 5G in information and communication technologies typically requires massive investments in R&D. It therefore generates large portfolios of related patents, part of which are standard-essential patents (SEPs) that are by definition infringed whenever the respective standard is implemented. This research project develops a novel method based on semantic data analysis to detect such standard essential patents. It provides valuable insights into the patent landscape around major ICT standard while enhancing transparency for the licensing of SEPs.
