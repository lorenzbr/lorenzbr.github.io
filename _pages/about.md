Hello and welcome on my personal website!

As a passionate data scientist and engineer, I am aiming at creating value through the use of software tools, data
and algorithms. For almost ten years, I have been using the programming language R for ETL, data analysis and
visualizations. One of my strengths is the automation of processes which generate and use complex data (e.g.,
documents, text, large data). Moreover, I enjoy using R Shiny and AWS for visualizations and the creation of web
applications. I am always curious and open for new technologies in the fields of data engineering, machine
learning and data visualization.

Further information on current and previous projects are shown on my webpage. Currently, I am open to new opportunities. Looking forward to get in touch with you!
