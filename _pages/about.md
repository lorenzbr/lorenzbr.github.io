Welcome on my personal website!

I am a Research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition in Munich. My work at the MPI focuses on quantitative economic research in the field of telecommunication standards and standard-essential patents (SEPs). A major aspect of my research lies on the prediction of SEPs and on the large-scale matching of patent documents and documents of technical standards applying semantics-based techniques. Moreover, I use econometric methods to answer policy and industry-relevant research questions.

During my time at the Max Planck Institute and the University of Munich, I conducted a doctoral thesis and a Master of Business Research focusing on quantitative research methods, machine learning and big data.
I received a Master of Science in Economics and studied at universities in Heidelberg and Hong Kong. I conducted a master thesis in innovation research and worked as a research assistant at the Centre for European Economic Research in Mannheim where I implemented an estimator for generalized linear models using incomplete data in R.

I received a Bachelor of Science in Physics from the Heidelberg University. During my studies in Heidelberg and Manchester, I specialized in biophysics and medical physics and conducted a bachelor thesis in the field of heavy ion therapy at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg.

Besides my professional life, I am generally interested in data-driven projects. In my free time, I recently started to develop a tool to track the financial performance of investment portfolios. It results in three R packages (which will become available on GitHub asap). The goal of this project is to not lose track of your investments in the stock market which can easily become the case over the years. This tool tries to automate the entire process from the extraction of transaction data from bank statements to the analysis and visualization of the investment portfolio performance.

Apart from this project, I am generally interested in data-driven projects in science and finance. While I am a huge enthusiast of the programming language R, I also enjoy using other languages and I am always curious to learn new things. Currently, I am looking forward to new opportunities.
